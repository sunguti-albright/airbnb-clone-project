# AIRBNB CLONE PROJECT

## About the project
The Goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.



## Tech Stack Used
+ Frontend: React (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

+ Backend: Python (Django)

+ Version Control: Git & GitHub

+ Design Tools: Figma``

+ Hosting: AWS

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create an intuitive and seamless booking flow  
- Maintain visual consistency across pages  
- Ensure fast loading and responsiveness  
- Prioritize mobile-first design  
- Meet accessibility standards (WCAG guidelines)  

### Key Features
- Property search and filtering  
- Detailed property viewing (images, amenities, reviews, availability)  
- Secure and simple checkout process  
- User authentication for bookings and profiles  

### Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a grid of available properties with filters (location, price, amenities, rating). |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows full property details: images, host info, amenities, reviews, map, and booking form. |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Streamlined page for entering guest details, reviewing booking summary, and confirming payment. |

### Importance of a User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly booking system minimizes friction, increases trust, and encourages conversions. Clear navigation, responsive layouts, and transparent pricing help users make confident decisions, while accessibility ensures the platform is usable by a wider audience.
